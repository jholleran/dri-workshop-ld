# The *Authors N' Books* Linked Data app

On 25 Oct 2012 we hold a [skills workshop](http://dri.ie/skills-workshops "Skills Workshops | Digital Repository Ireland") on 'Linked Data in the Digital Humanities', part of the 'Realising the Opportunities of Digital Humanities' event, organised by the Digital Repository Ireland ([DRI](http://dri.ie/)), Royal Irish Academy in Dublin.

## Purpose
This little Web application, developed by [Nuno](http://www.dri.ie/nuno-lopes) and [Michael](http://www.dri.ie/michael-hausenblas), demonstrates the power of Linked Data. It is driven by Linked Data we generated ourselves (well, actually [Anna](http://www.deri.ie/about/team/member/anna_dabrowska/) did the heavy lifting) and is served from a dedicated [SPARQL endpoint](http://dydra.com/mhausenblas/realising-opportunities-digital-humanities/sparql).
