This workshop will introduce participants to Linked Data, a key semantic web technology, and its uses in the digital
humanities. Through examples of Linked Data websites and applications, we will explore how Linked Data is being used by
individual digital humanities scholars, by organisations such as the BBC and the Central Statistics Office, and by
cultural heritage institutions worldwide. We will make comparisons to other approaches to structuring data (including
markup and metadata approaches such as TEI and XML) and discuss best practices for creating and reusing Linked Data
(such as the importance of identifiers and standard vocabularies). Participants will also be introduced to tools for
creating and exploring Linked Data. The workshop will also include a hands-on exercise in creating Linked Data.
